# Page Scroll Indicator

This project showcases the beauty and simplicity of a **Page Scroll Indicator** implemented using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The indicator provides a visual cue for users to track their scrolling progress on the webpage.

## Features

- **Minimalist Design:** A sleek, unobtrusive scroll indicator that seamlessly integrates with your webpage.
- **Responsive:** Works smoothly on all screen sizes and modern browsers.
- **Lightweight:** No external libraries required; pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable to match your website's theme.

## How It Works

The scroll indicator dynamically updates its width as the user scrolls through the page. This is achieved by capturing the `scroll` event and calculating the scroll position relative to the total page height.

## File Structure

```plaintext
.
├── index.html   # Markup for the webpage
├── styles.css   # Styling for the page and the scroll indicator
└── script.js    # Logic for updating the scroll indicator
